# Case-GPT
##### By Adish Shah and Abhyuday Singh

## Inspiration
#### The inspiration for Case-GPT arose from the desire to create a realistic and interactive platform for practicing consulting casing interviews. Combining a passion for artificial intelligence and professional development, the goal was to provide individuals with a low-pressure environment to hone their problem-solving skills and receive real-time feedback when practicing for job interviews.

## What it does
#### Case-GPT acts as an AI-powered interviewer, engaging in interactive casing interviews with human participants. The AI presents business cases, asks probing questions, and evaluates responses. Participants analyze problems, develop solutions, and communicate recommendations. The AI dynamically adapts its questioning based on those user-given responses, providing a realistic simulation.

## How we built it
#### Case-GPT was built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and open artificial intelligence models, leveraging Meta's LLama-2 model which was fine-tuned and prompt engineered for casing interviews. We used api endpoints to call the LLM from together-ai for scalability.

## What's next for case-gpt
#### Future plans for Case-GPT include expanding case study availability - particularly so by finetuning the LLM to learn from being given a case then framing questions by itself, and integrating additional learning resources. Possible collaboration with consulting firms and educational institutions can also aim improve Case-GPT by bringing more relevant training data to the model, benefiting more individuals seeking effective interview practice.
